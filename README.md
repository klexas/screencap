# Instructions
Should be straight-forward enough. Open the solution with Visual Studio, VS2013 was used for the production of this however there are no obscure dependancies so it should be fine even from an msbuild command.

Opneing the project there is a dependancy on `SharpAvi`, this should be included in the repo, if not just get the latest version from nuGet. 

Start recording and you will see an output:

Enjoy, feel free to expand and submit issues. There will be limited support for this however not extensive as this was only written to serve an immediate purpose without paying for screen capture software loaded with adWare.
